# RailwayManagement
The application that will be used to simulate and maintain the logistics of the railway infrastructure, including railway stations, connections, line intersections and different train implementations.
There are different types of railroad cars. Each type of railroad car has different characteristics
Trainsets move along routes (determined according to the indicated objects of the starting and destination railway station). The route between the railway stations must be determined each time (it does not have to be the shortest route, but each time it must be determined algorithmically on the basis of the graph of railway connections)
